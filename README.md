# Krittika
Stuff I've done as a part of [Krittika](https://krittikaiitb.github.io/)'s annual projects. 

Download the 353 GHz data for Planck All Sky Maps from [here](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release_3/all-sky-maps/), which I couldn't upload on GitHub due to file size restrictions. You can also find some cool images obtained from the Planck mission at their official [website](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Planck).
